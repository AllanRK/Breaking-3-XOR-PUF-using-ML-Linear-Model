# Breaking 3-XOR PUF using ML Linear Model (CS771)


## Project Overview

The project involves the development of a linear model to break the 3-XOR PUF using machine learning techniques. The model was built from scratch using Python and NumPy. The key highlights of the project are:

- Engineering an SVM-based solver to predict XOR-PUF responses.
- Creating advanced feature mapping techniques to effectively capture the PUF behavior.
- Evaluation of the model on a dataset of 10,000 training and 20,000 testing challenge-response pairs.
- Achieving an impressive 99% accuracy in predicting XOR-PUF responses, even in the presence of multiple PUFs and the odd-even rule.


## Results

The model achieved remarkable results, achieving a 99% accuracy in predicting XOR-PUF responses.
